# DRAWING ON THE WEB: FINAL PROJECT
Spring 2016

----------

## FINAL PROJECT
Minimalistic parallax environment contained in a canvas tag - featuring P5.js, randomly generated elements, and user interactive behavior. Trees are randomly generated using a while loop, and most shapes are rendered directly in the canvas. A few elements, such as the house and bush, are bitmap images.

The door can be clicked access a promotional page for Kentucky Route Zero, the game that inspired the visual aspect of this project. This project was also inspired by GitHub's own 404 and 500 pages, which also feature parallax behavior.
